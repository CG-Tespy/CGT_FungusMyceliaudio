# CGT FungusMyceliaudio (FMA)

An alternative to Fungus's built-in Audio system. What separates this from the built-in one (at the time of this writing) are the following:

* Flexible Audio-Balancing, meaning you can set the volume and pitch of different tracks separately
  * As opposed to how Fungus's built-in sys forces you to have the BGM and SFX working off the exact same volume level, making balancing the audio harder
* Variable Compatibility
  * The Commands in this system are a lot more Flowchart-friendly, letting you change the settings through variables instead of having to use hard-coded values
* Easy Crossfading and Ambience
  * You can have two or more BGM tracks active at the same time, allowing you to crossfade audio like in certain Fire Emblem games (Fodlan Winds, anyone?)
  * You can have plenty of different looping SFX playing at the same time, giving you more freedom in implementing ambient sound

<br>I don't know if the original system does the same thing, but you can easily have your own custom code respond to (and trigger) various things FMA can do. Like playing or stopping audio on a specific track. **To get started, please read the User Guide and play around with the demo scenes.**

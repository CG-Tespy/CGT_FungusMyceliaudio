# CGT_FungusAudioSystem

An alternative to Fungus's built-in Audio system. What separates this from the built-in one (at the time of this writing) are the following:
* You can set the volumes of the different sound types (music, sfx and ambience) separately
* Thanks to the AudioEvents class, you can have your scripts respond to the different ways sound gets affected
  * Played, volume-changed, and so on
* You can use Fungus FloatVariables to set things like the volume, fade duration, etc
